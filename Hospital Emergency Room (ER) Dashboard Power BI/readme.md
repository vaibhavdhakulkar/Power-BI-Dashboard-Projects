#  🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a complete analytical system for monitoring and optimizing Emergency Room (ER) operations.
The dashboard evaluates patient volume, waiting time efficiency, satisfaction levels, admission status, and department referral patterns to support data-driven decision-making for hospital management.

### The solution is divided into three dashboards to offer insights at different levels:
- Monthly View
- Consolidated View
- Patient Details

## 🎯 Project Objectives
✔ Track ER patient flow and identify peak demand timelines<br>
✔ Improve speed and quality of patient service by analyzing wait time and satisfaction score trends<br>
✔ Understand referral patterns to manage department workload and resource distribution<br>
✔ Enable granular patient-level monitoring for case audits and service quality improvement<br>

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- KPI	Definition
- Total Number of Patients	Total patient visits per day
- Average Wait Time	Average time before first medical attention
- Patient Satisfaction Score	Daily satisfaction rating
- Number of Patients Referred	Patients transferred to other departments<br>

Each KPI is visualized with area sparklines to highlight daily trends and fluctuations, enabling identification of high-load days and operational inefficiencies.

## 🧩 Dashboard 1: Monthly View
- Purpose: Analyze month-by-month performance to identify seasonal trends and operational bottlenecks.

## Visuals Included:
- 📈 Patient Admission Status (Admitted vs Not Admitted)
- 👶🧓 Patient Age Distribution (10-year age groups)
- 🏥 Department Referrals across specialties
- ⏱ Timeliness Metrics – % of patients attended within 30 minutes
- 🚻 Gender-Based Patient Distribution
- 🌍 Racial Demographics
- 📅⏰ Time Analysis by day & hour to detect peak periods

## 📍 Dashboard 2: Consolidated View
Purpose: Provide a holistic performance overview for a custom date range selected by the user.<br>

Highlights:
- Total patient count
- Avg. wait time & satisfaction score
- Admission percentage
- Referral trends with department-wise breakdown
- Demographic summary (age, gender, race)
- Trend monitoring across user-selected timeline
- Ideal for quarterly, annual and operational planning reviews.

## 🔍 Dashboard 3: Patient Details
Purpose: Offer granular insights into individual patient records to support quality improvement and operational accuracy.

Fields Displayed:
- Field
- Patient ID
- Patient Name
- Gender
- Age
- Admission Date
- Race
- Wait Time
- Department Referral
- Admission Status<br>

The grid allows filtering and drill-down to investigate delayed cases, dissatisfaction incidents, or department workload issues.

## 🔑 Tools & Technologies Used
- Technology	Purpose
- Power BI Desktop	Data modeling & dashboard development
- DAX	KPIs, time intelligence & calculated measures
- Power Query	Data cleaning & transformation
- Excel / CSV dataset	Data source
  
## 🌟 Skills Demonstrated
- KPI design & DAX calculations
- Slicers for dynamic date range & drill-through navigation
- Data modeling & table relationships
- Interactive dashboards with sparklines & heatmaps
- Storytelling via data visualization for real-world operations

## 📌 Sample Insights Derived (Examples)
- ER patient inflow peaks between 6 PM – 10 PM, indicating a need for higher staffing during these hours.
- Patients above 50 years old show the highest admission rate, indicating more critical medical conditions.
- Cardiology and Orthopedics receive the highest referrals, suggesting strategic resource prioritization.
- Longer wait time days correlate with lower patient satisfaction scores, validating the need for workload optimization.

## 🚀 Future Scope (Optional Enhancements)
- Integration with real-time hospital database / API
- Predictive model to forecast patient volume
- Patient risk score based on demographics & wait time
- Mobile-responsive Power BI report for ER doctors/nurses

## 🙌 Acknowledgment
This project is purely for analytical, educational and portfolio purposes and aims to demonstrate the potential of BI in improving healthcare operations.<br>
