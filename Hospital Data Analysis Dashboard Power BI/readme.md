# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an interactive Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into patient distribution, demographics, specialty groups, and overall hospital performance metrics.

It helps stakeholders analyze patient trends, age distribution, case categories, and district-wise performance to support data-driven healthcare decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Analyze total patient volume and case distribution
- Compare Adult vs Child patient cases
- Evaluate patient distribution by age group
- Identify top-performing medical specialty groups
- Analyze district-wise patient distribution
- Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic filtering and insights

## 📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)

### The dashboard includes high-level KPIs such as:
- 👥 Total Patients – 453K
- 🧑 Adult Cases – 368K
- 👶 Child Cases – 85K
- 🏥 In-Patients – 182K
- 🚶 Out-Patients – 271K
- These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of hospital performance.

### 📈 Dashboard Features
### 🔹 Patient Category Analysis
- Adult vs Child distribution (Donut Chart)
- Percentage contribution of each category

### 🔹 Age Group Analysis
- 0–15
- 16–64
- 65+
- Visual breakdown with percentage contribution

### 🔹 Specialty Group Analysis
- Total patients by specialty (Bones, ENT, Heart, Urine, General, etc.)
- Comparative bar chart fo performance evaluation

### 🔹 District-Wise Analysis
- Total patients by district
- Scrollable bar chart for geographic insights

### 🔹 Interactive Filters
- 📅 Date Range Filter
- 🏷 District Filter
- 🏥 Specialty Group Filter
- All visuals update dynamically based on selected filters.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Data Modeling & Relationships

## 🔍 Insights Generated
- Majority of patients fall in the 16–64 age group
- Adult cases significantly higher than child cases
- Out-patients exceed in-patients
- Certain specialty groups handle significantly higher patient volume
- District-wise variation in patient distribution
